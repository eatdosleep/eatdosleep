You give it the basics:
* 📍 Destination & Dates

* 👥 Who's Going (Solo, Couple, Family, Friends?)
* 💰 Your Budget Level
...and our AI crafts a detailed, personalized day-by-day itinerary in minutes! ✨ It suggests activities, restaurants, timings, estimated costs, and even hidden gems, all tailored to you.
But it's not just AI generation:
* ✏️ Fully Customizable: The AI plan is your starting point. Easily drag-and-drop, add your must-dos, swap places, tweak times – our editor makes it simple.
